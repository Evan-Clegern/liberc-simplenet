# liberc-simplenet
A simple C++ extension of the integrated Linux "sys/sockets.h" system, with error messages and general polish. There is still some more cleanup and documentation to be done, but it does work (at least on loopback, with different ports).


The files "client_man.cpp" and "server_man.cpp" illustrate a simple UDP "ping" and TCP session system with the library.
